# Drag and Drop Board

This is a simple drag and drop board. It is built using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) and [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/).

For drag and drop, a [fork](https://github.com/hello-pangea/dnd) of the library [react-beautiful-dnd](https://github.com/atlassian/react-beautiful-dnd) is used.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) with your browser to see the result.
